# Advent of Code 2017 solutions

Just sharing my solutions for Advent of Code 2017.

I don't claim to be fluent in any of these langauges except C#. If you see something I'm doing which is very obviously wrong or even just can suggest a more efficient or idiomatic approach in one of the other languages, the feedback is appreciated.

## C#

Solutions assume .Net Core 2.0

## Elixir

Solutions assume Elixir 1.5

## Python

Solutions assume Python 3.6.

Run `pip install pytest` to enable unit test support

Run solutions with e.g. `python day01.py`

Run tests with `py.test day01.py`

## Rust

hmm.. maybe

## Scala

hm.. maybe

## Misc tips

If using Atom, configure or disable the `whitespace` package to stop newlines being added to the end of input files when saved
